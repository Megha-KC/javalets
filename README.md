A series of examples to teach concepts in java.

Java is a lot, and we will learn java, one concept a week.

Weeks

1. Simple Java program - done
2. Make a simple libary and use it in an app
3. Use a public library in an app
4. Create a simple http-server in java. render an html in that. Is it possible to do it without using any dependency manager?
5. If we can do it without, next step is to do it with a dependency manger. Stick with Gradle. 
6. Next we use more, out of the box tools to make a rest server.
7. We learn to make more gradle things like java libraries, jvm libraries, java modules, java applications. (See [this](https://gradle.org/guides/))
